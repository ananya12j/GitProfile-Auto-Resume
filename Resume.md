### 📌 Notes & Next steps
- If a project's README is long, the script uses the **first paragraph** as the summary.
- Want longer summaries or full README extracts? I can update the script to include more content or to fetch remote README files via the GitHub API.
- Want charts, badges, or a PDF export? I can add those next.
